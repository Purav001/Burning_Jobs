              Begin by adding a small amount of previously prepared yogurt
              (dahi) or cultured buttermilk (lassi) to warm milk in a clean
              container.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6 text-[#854e23] font-bold">
              Stir the mixture gently, ensuring the culture is evenly
              distributed throughout the milk.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6 text-[#854e23] font-bold">
              Cover the container securely and place it in a warm, draft-free
              area overnight, allowing the beneficial bacteria to ferment the
              milk and turn it into dahi.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6 text-[#854e23] font-bold">
              Utilize the freshly prepared dahi to churn butter using the
              traditional bilona method, resulting in rich and creamy homemade
              makhan (butter) of exceptional quality and flavor.

              Aryuvedic Bilona Method
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-6 text-[#854e23] font-bold">
              The Aryurvedic Bilona Method, practiced at Nani's Bilona Ghee,
              involves churning curd made from A2 cow milk in a traditional
              wooden churner called "bilona".
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6 text-[#854e23] font-bold">
              This ancient technique preserves the natural qualities of the
              milk, including its A2 protein content, by avoiding high-speed
              mechanical processes.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6 text-[#854e23] font-bold">
              The slow churning process allows for the separation of butter
              (makhan) from the buttermilk (lassi), ensuring the retention of
              essential nutrients and flavors.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6 text-[#854e23] font-bold">
              The butter obtained through the Bilona Method is then gently
              heated and clarified to produce pure, golden A2 cow ghee of
              superior quality and nutritional value.

              Once churned using the Bilona Method, the curd transforms into

              This freshly churned butter is rich in flavor and nutrients,

            <p class="mb-6 text-[#854e23] font-bold">
              The makhan is carefully collected and prepared for the final step

            <p class="mb-6 text-[#854e23] font-bold">
              Through meticulous heating and clarification, the makhan is
